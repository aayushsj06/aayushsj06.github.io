<p><b><i><img src="674944-glenn-maxwell.jpg" width="300" height="300" align="left"> <font size="4" color="grey">Maxwell made his debut for Australia against Afghanistan in a One Day International in the United Arab Emirates in 2012. In his 2nd ODI, against Pakistan, he hit an unbeaten 56 and a six to seal a victory for Australia. He was then selected in Australia's squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20. Maxwell was then selected in a 13-man squad for the 2013 Sydney Test match against Sri Lanka as a replacement for Shane Watson who injured his calf. On 10 January 2013, on his ODI debut against Sri Lanka, he was involved in two run outs off consecutive balls. He had a wicketless series against Sri Lanka, and also failed to reach double figures in the 3 innings with the bat.

On 1 February, he scored 51* (from 35 balls) as an opener as Australia chased down the target of 71 set by the West Indies. On 3 February in the 2nd ODI against West Indies at Perth, he scored a duck, but then took 4/63 with the ball to support Mitchell Starc (5/32) and bowl out the visitors for 212 in 38.1 overs.

On March 2013, he made his Test debut against India in the second Test at Hyderabad.[10] He was included as the second spinner in the team supporting the main spinner Xavier Doherty.

Maxwell's teammates gave him the nickname "The Big Show" due to his confidence.[11] Maxwell now dislikes the nickname and is trying to replace it with the nickname "Maxy".[12]
