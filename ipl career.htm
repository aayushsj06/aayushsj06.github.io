Maxwell proved to be the most expensive player sold at the 2013 IPL Auctions, where Mumbai Indians bought him for 1 million US dollars.[13] But he was out of the Mumbai Indians retention team 2014 as per IPL 2014 retainment rules, and was subsequently bought by Kings XI Punjab. In his team's opening match against Chennai Super Kings, he played an excellent innings by scoring 95 runs from 43 balls (with 15 fours and two sixes) to chase down a target of 206 in 18.5 overs which is an exact replica of the innings against Pakistan in Bangladesh in 2014. In the second match of his team played against Rajasthan Royals, he hit a flawless 89 off 45 balls with eight fours and six sixes, which included frequent reverse shots. This knock of his laid the foundation for Kings XI Punjab win against a high score target. In third match maxwell played stupendous innings against Sunrisers Hyderabad.He smashed with 95 runs from 43 balls with 9 sixes and 5 fours and has been awarded with Man of the Match award third time in a row, which is a rare record in IPL track record.
